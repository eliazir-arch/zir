# ROTC Letter — Day 7

```text
Good evening, Ma'am.

I feel lucky today since I got to see you a little longer than usual—haha, kyut kaayo as always.

By the way, I just want you to know that I really hope only you are aware of my admiration, Ma'am. If ever it bothers or annoys you in any way, please just tell me honestly. I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable—it’s the last thing I’d want. Promise, I’ll behave haha.

Respectfully,
